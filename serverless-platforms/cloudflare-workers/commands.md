## Cloudflare Workers

### **Overview**

Cloudflare Workers is a serverless execution environment that allows you to run JavaScript, TypeScript, or WebAssembly code directly on Cloudflare's global network. Workers provide a way to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses, enabling you to build performant, scalable, and highly customizable web applications and APIs. You pay only for the compute time your code consumes.

### **Key Features**

*   **Serverless:** No servers to manage or provision.
*   **Edge Computing:** Code is executed on Cloudflare's global network, closer to your users, resulting in low latency.
*   **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Primarily uses JavaScript and TypeScript, leveraging the familiar web development ecosystem.
*   **WebAssembly:** Supports WebAssembly for executing code written in other languages.
*   **KV Store:** Provides a key-value store (Workers KV) for persistent data storage.
*   **Durable Objects:** Offers Durable Objects for stateful serverless applications.
*   **Automatic Scaling:** Workers automatically scale to handle incoming traffic.
*   **Pay-Per-Use:** You pay only for the resources consumed when your code is running.
*   **Integration with Cloudflare Services:** Integrates seamlessly with Cloudflare's CDN, DNS, security features, and more.

### **Use Cases**

*   **A/B Testing:** Implement A/B testing by modifying HTTP requests and responses.
*   **Content Transformation:** Modify images, HTML, and other content on the fly.
*   **API Gateways:** Build API gateways to route and transform API requests.
*   **Authentication:** Implement authentication and authorization logic.
*   **Server-Side Rendering:** Perform server-side rendering of web pages.
*   **Caching:** Implement custom caching strategies.
*   **Bot Management:** Detect and block malicious bots.

### **Setting Up Cloudflare Workers**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   A Cloudflare account with a domain registered and managed through Cloudflare.
    *   The `wrangler` CLI tool installed and configured.
    *   A Cloudflare API token with the necessary permissions.

2.  **Install the `wrangler` CLI:**

    ```bash
    npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
    ```

    `wrangler` is the command-line tool for managing Cloudflare Workers.

3.  **Authenticate `wrangler` with your Cloudflare Account:**

    ```bash
    wrangler login
    ```

    This command will open a browser window and prompt you to authenticate with your Cloudflare account. Alternatively, you can use an API token:

    ```bash
    wrangler config --api-token <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_API_TOKEN>` with your Cloudflare API token. The token needs the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" permission.

4.  **Create a New Worker Project:**

    ```bash
    wrangler init my-worker
    cd my-worker
    ```

    This creates a new directory named `my-worker` and initializes a basic Worker project.

### **Cloudflare Workers Commands (wrangler CLI)**

1.  **Create a New Worker Project:**

    ```bash
    wrangler init my-worker
    ```

    Creates a new directory and initializes a Worker project with a basic template.

2.  **Develop and Test Locally:**

    ```bash
    wrangler dev
    ```

    Starts a local development server for testing your Worker. This requires a Cloudflare account and zone ID for previewing, but doesn't deploy.

3.  **Deploy a Worker:**

    ```bash
    wrangler deploy
    ```

    Deploys your Worker to Cloudflare's global network. This requires a `wrangler.toml` file (automatically created by `wrangler init`).

4.  **Tail Logs:**

    ```bash
    wrangler tail
    ```

    Streams logs from your deployed Worker to the console. Requires a Cloudflare account and deployed Worker.

5.  **Manage Secrets:**

    ```bash
    wrangler secret put <secret_name>
    ```

    Adds a secret that is securely stored and available to your Worker at runtime.  Replace `<secret_name>` with the name of your secret.

6.  **Preview Worker in Browser:**

    ```bash
    wrangler preview
    ```

    Opens a browser window to preview the worker.

### **Example Cloudflare Worker Code**

#### JavaScript (`index.js` or `src/index.js`)

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  return new Response(`Hello from Cloudflare Workers! You requested: ${url.pathname}`);
}

Use code with caution.

Explanation: This simple Worker intercepts all HTTP requests and returns a "Hello from Cloudflare Workers!" message along with the requested path.

TypeScript (src/index.ts)
addEventListener('fetch', (event: FetchEvent) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  return new Response(`Hello from Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript)! You requested: ${url.pathname}`);
}
```

### Domain Configuration for Exim Mail Server on Windows

## Prerequisites
- A Windows server with administrative (root) privileges.
- A valid domain name (e.g., example.com).
- Cygwin installed on your system with Exim package.
- A valid SSL/TLS certificate (for SSL configuration).

#### Non-SSL Configuration
Edit the main Exim configuration file located at `/etc/exim/exim.conf` within the Cygwin environment.

```ini
# Basic Exim configuration for mail delivery
primary_hostname = mail.example.com
domainlist local_domains = @ : example.com
smarthost = 

# Relay settings
interface_list = *
host_lookup = *
transport_smtp = smtp

# Mailbox settings
message_spool_directory = /var/mail
delivery_mode = smtp

# Restrict mail relay
acl_check_rcpt = acl_check_rcpt_local

# Logging
log_file_path = /var/log/exim/mainlog
log_selector = +all
``` 

#### SSL Configuration

To enable SSL/TLS encryption for Exim, modify the following configuration files.

`/etc/exim/exim.conf` (within the Cygwin environment):

```ini
# Enable TLS encryption
tls_certificate = /etc/ssl/certs/exim.pem
tls_privatekey = /etc/ssl/private/exim.key
tls_require_ciphers = HIGH
``` 

Make sure the paths to the certificate and private key files are correct.

`/etc/exim/exim.conf` (within the Cygwin environment):

Enable secure SMTP:

#### Enable secure SMTP:

```ini
# Enable secure SMTP
smtp_accept_max = 100
tls_on_connect_ports = 465
```

#### Virtual Alias Configuration

Exim stores virtual alias mappings in the `/etc/exim/virtual` file within the Cygwin environment.

```ini
# Virtual alias mappings
admin@example.com    user1
info@example.com     user2
support@example.com  user3
@example.com         catchall
```

After updating the `virtual` file, run the following command to apply the changes within the Cygwin environment:

```shell
exim -bV
```

#### Commands to Manage Exim (within the Cygwin environment)

- **Start Exim:**
  ```shell
  cygrunsrv -S exim 
  ```
- **Stop Exim:**
  ```shell
  cygrunsrv -E exim
  ```
- **Restart Exim:**
  ```shell
  cygrunsrv -R exim
  ```
- **Reload Configuration:**
  ```shell
  exim -qff
  ```
- **Check Status:**
  ```shell
  cygrunsrv -Q exim
  ```

#### Log Files for Debugging

- **View Mail Logs:**
  ```shell
  tail -f /var/log/exim/mainlog
  ```
- **View Authentication Logs:**
  ```shell
  tail -f /var/log/exim/rejectlog
  ```

#### Test Email Sending and Receiving

After configuring Exim, test the server by sending and receiving emails.

To send a test email using the `mail` command (within the Cygwin environment):

  ```shell
  echo "Test message body" | mail -s "Test Subject" user@example.com
  ```
  
This configuration should help you set up Exim on a Windows environment using Cygwin. Adjust the settings according to your specific requirements and environment.
